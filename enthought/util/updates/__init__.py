""" This packages contains classes that are used by the UpdateChecker plugin
as well as supporting command-line tools for building and managing update
files on a remote server.

This package is separate from the UpdateChecker plugin because it has no
external dependencies and might need to be imported and run on deployment
servers that don't have a full Enthought development environment.
