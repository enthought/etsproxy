###   A globally-unique identifier made up of time and ip and 8 random digits: 40 characters wide
###
###   A globally unique identifier that combines ip, time, and random bits.  Since the
###   time is listed first, you can sort records by guid.  You can also extract the time
###   and ip if needed.
###
###   GUIDs make wonderful database keys.  They require no access to the
###   database (to get the max index number), they are extremely unique, and they sort
###   automatically by time.   GUIDs prevent key clashes when merging
###   two databases together, combining data, or generating keys in distributed
###   systems.
###
###   There is an Internet Draft for UUIDs, but this module does not implement it.
###   If the draft catches on, perhaps I'll conform the module to it.

# Changelog
# Sometime, 1997     Created the Java version of GUID
#                    Went through many versions in Java
# Sometime, 2002     Created the Python version of GUID, mirroring the Java version
# November 24, 2003  Changed Python version to be more pythonic, took out object and made just a module
# December 2, 2003   Fixed duplicating GUIDs.  Sometimes they duplicate if multiples are created
#                    in the same millisecond (it checks the last 100 GUIDs now and has a larger random part)
# December 9, 2003   Fixed MAX_RANDOM, which was going over sys.maxint
#
