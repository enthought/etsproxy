#
#  Enthought developer tools.
#
#  These tools are intended to help developers debug and test Traits-based
#  code running within an application framework.
#
#  For the most part, these tools also make heavy use of the DockWindow
#  'feature' capability to implement their functionality. As a result, the
#  appropriate DockWindow features must also be included in the application
#  framework by adding the appropriate Feature extensions (see the
#  enthought.pyface.dock.feature package for more information).
