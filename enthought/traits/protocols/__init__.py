"""Trivial Interfaces and Adaptation from PyProtocols.

This package is a subset of the files from Phillip J. Eby's
PyProtocols package. They are only included here to help remove dependencies
on external packages from the Traits package. The code has been reorganized to
address circular imports that were discovered when explicit relative imports
were added.
